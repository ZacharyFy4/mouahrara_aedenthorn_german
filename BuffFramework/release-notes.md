```json

				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

* Fixed an issue where some optional fields could not be manually set to `null` 🔧

## 0.6.1-unofficial.5-mouahrara

* The **HealthRegeneration** and **StaminaRegeneration** fields now support floating-point values ✨

## 0.6.1-unofficial.4-mouahrara
Released on 05 June, 2024, for SMAPI 4.0.0 or later.
* Fixed an issue where if one or more entries specified an additional buff with equipment-based conditions, the buff would only apply if the equipment-based conditions for one of the entries for that specific buff were met, preventing the buff from being applied by any source other than the framework 🔧

## 0.6.1-unofficial.3-mouahrara
Released on 12 May, 2024, for SMAPI 4.0.0 or later.
* Added the following fields:
  * DisplayName
  * AdditionalBuffs
* Added the following aliases:
  * DisplayName ↔ Name
  * Description ↔ DisplayDescription
  * IconSheetIndex ↔ SheetIndex ↔ IconSpriteIndex
  * IconTexture ↔ TexturePath
  * Visible ↔ Visibility
  * MaxStamina ↔ MaxEnergy
  * StaminaRegeneration ↔ StaminaRegen ↔ EnergyRegeneration ↔ EnergyRegen
  * Glow ↔ GlowColor
* Fixed an issue where the buff icon was not displayed for base game buffs 🔧
* Fixed an issue where if multiple entries specified the same buff with equipment-based conditions, the buff would only apply if all equipment-based conditions from all entries for that specific buff were met 🔧

The new **AdditionalBuffs** field allows you to specify a list of buffs to apply in addition to the current custom buff. It's important to note that you cannot define another custom buff added via the framework as an additional buff. The **duration**, **source**, and **visibility** of buffs added in this way match those of the custom buff in which they are defined. However, you can modify the visibility by explicitly defining the **Visible** field.

For example, the following content pack adds a buff that grants +1 attack and +32 magnetism, while also applying the **Monster Musk** buff (Id: 24) invisibly when the Soul Sapper Ring is equipped:

```json
{
	"Format": "2.0.0",
	"Changes": [
		{
			"Action": "EditData",
			"Target": "aedenthorn.BuffFramework/dictionary",
			"Entries": {
				"YourName.YourModName/SoulSapperRing": {
					"Id": "YourName.YourModName/SoulSapperRing",
					"Name": "{{i18n:SoulSapperRing.Name}}",
					"Description": "{{i18n:SoulSapperRing.Description}}",
					"Source": "TheInternalNameOfYourBuffSource",
					"DisplaySource": "{{i18n:SoulSapperRing.Source}}",
					"IconSheetIndex": 14,
					"Ring": "Soul Sapper Ring",
					"Attack": "1",
					"MagneticRadius": "32",
					"AdditionalBuffs": [
						{
							"Id": "24",
							"Visible": false
						}
					],
					"Sound": "cowboy_powerup"
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

It is now **strongly recommended** to use this field if you intend to create a custom buff based on a base game buff to avoid potential conflicts with other mods.

## 0.6.1-unofficial.2-mouahrara
Released on 28 April, 2024, for SMAPI 4.0.0 or later.
* Fixed a minor bug 🔧

  * Id ↔ BuffId
  * IconSheetIndex ↔ SheetIndex
  * FarmingLevel ↔ Farming
  * MiningLevel ↔ Mining
  * FishingLevel ↔ Fishing
  * ForagingLevel ↔ Foraging
  * CombatLevel ↔ Combat
  * KnockbackMultiplier ↔ WeightMultiplier
  * HealthRegeneration ↔ HealthRegen
  * StaminaRegeneration ↔ StaminaRegen
* An error icon is now displayed if the **SheetIndex** and **TexturePath** fields are both missing ✨
* Sounds are now paused during events and festivals 🔧
* Fixed an issue where the **Glow** field did not correctly consider the alpha (A) value 🔧
* Removed **TextureScale** field. Textures are now automatically resized to the correct size 🗑️
* Removed the unimplemented **Crafting** and **Digging** buffs 🗑️

Please note that a large part of the code has been rewritten to implement custom buffs thanks to the overhaul of buffs in version 1.6. The update should still be fully compatible with the old content packs. With these changes, the **Which** field is deprecated; it is kept for backward compatibility, but it is now recommended to always use **Id**. Additionally, it is no longer necessary to write the effects of buffs in the description for most of them, as they are automatically displayed by the game.
